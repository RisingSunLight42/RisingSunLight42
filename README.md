# ðŸ’» About me

I'm a young student in IT from France. I want to work in cybersecurity, but as a dev enthousiast, everything interest me!
As I'm currently in an apprenticeship where I mainly use Symfony, I've been quite curious about the PHP ecosystem lately (I even got to Symfony Live 2025 in Paris!).
